      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Randi Umphrey, a versatile graphic designer with a strong foundation in programming. At 34 years old, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative flair to the world of design.
        My journey began with a deep fascination for coding and problem-solving, which eventually led me to explore the vibrant realm of graphic design. My programming background has not only equipped me with a sharp eye for detail but has also instilled in me a love for structure, logic, and the elegant intersection of technology and art.
        Over the years, I've honed my design skills while keeping up with the ever-evolving digital landscape. This has allowed me to create visually compelling, user-friendly designs that resonate with audiences in the digital age.
        I'm passionate about finding the perfect balance between form and function in my work. Whether it's developing a sleek website, designing eye-catching branding materials, or creating engaging user interfaces, I strive to make every pixel and line of code count.
        My love for design goes beyond the screen; it's deeply intertwined with my everyday life. I draw inspiration from the beauty of the digital world, just as I do from the intricacies of nature and the dynamic cityscapes around me. These experiences influence my creativity and contribute to the diverse and innovative solutions I bring to my projects.
        When I'm not busy crafting beautiful visuals or writing elegant code, you can often find me exploring the digital frontier, attending design conferences, or immersing myself in the latest design trends and technologies. I believe that in the world of design, learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm committed to staying at the forefront of this ever-evolving field.
        I'm excited to collaborate with clients who appreciate the marriage of design and technology. If you're seeking a graphic designer who not only understands the intricacies of your digital project but also has a keen eye for aesthetics and a passion for creating memorable user experiences, I'm here to bring your vision to life.
        Let's connect and embark on a creative journey together. I'm eager to apply my skills and background to make your design aspirations a reality.
